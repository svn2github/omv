Services that use monit to monitor their state and that should be able to be
enabled or disbaled via WebGUI must fulfill the following rules:

- The file must be located in /usr/share/openmediavault/scripts/monit.d
- The name of the script must be the same as the service entry name from the
  monitrc file

If a service needs to run permanently you can put the services' monit file
directly into the /etc/monit/conf.d directory.

Example:
--------

The script which creates the monit configuration file:
/usr/share/openmediavault/scripts/monit.d/mt-daapd

The script code:
check process mt-daapd with pidfile /var/run/mt-daapd.pid
  start program = "/etc/init.d/mt-daapd start"
  stop program = "/etc/init.d/mt-daapd stop"
  mode manual

Note, the script name and the service entry name from the monitrc file are
equal: 'mt-daapd'

check process ==> mt-daapd <== with pidfile /var/run/mt-daapd.pid
  ...
